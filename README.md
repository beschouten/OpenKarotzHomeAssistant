## Configuration Examples

### Automation Examples

#### Turn on LED when device starts
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Turn on LED on startup"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.device_state
        to: "running"
    action:
      - service: openkarotz.set_led
        data:
          color: "blue"
          brightness: 100
```

#### Play TTS on device startup
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Play TTS on startup"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.device_state
        to: "running"
    action:
      - service: openkarotz.play_tts
        data:
          text: "Device started"
          category: "notification"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure OpenKarotz device is accessible from Home Assistant
- Check IP address and port configuration
- Verify network connectivity
- Check device logs for errors

### Entity Not Appearing

- Wait for data synchronization (default: 30 seconds)
- Check connection status in device info
- Restart Home Assistant
- Verify device is responding to API requests

### API Errors

- Check device API documentation
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Review integration logs for detailed error messages
- Ensure proper authentication if required
